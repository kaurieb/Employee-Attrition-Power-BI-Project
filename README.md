# Human Resources Turnover Rate
## Project Background and Overview 
This analysis explores the root causes of employee attrition using a detailed HR dataset that spans demographics, compensation, departmental roles, performance metrics, and employee satisfaction. By identifying and uncovering patterns among high-risk groups such as early-tenure staff, low earners, specific departments, and underrepresented groups, this project highlights critical areas contributing to turnover. These insights will help HR leadership focus on the most impactful drivers of turnover and inform strategies to reduce attrition. To complement my analysis, an interactive Power BI dashboard visualizes critical metrics, enabling real-time tracking of attrition KPIs and at-risk employee profiles across the organization. 

The following five categories were prioritized for analysis based on their statistically significant correlation with attrition rates in our dataset, as well as their actionable potential for HR leadership to implement data-driven strategy. Hence, in this report, insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

1.	**Gender Disparities** :
   Why? Evaluating gender-based attrition patterns sheds light on turnover risks in the gender demographic. 
2.	**Salary-Driven Attrition** :
   Why? To explore the need for department-specific retention dynamics tied to wages or other possible non-salary factors leading to employee turnover.
3.	**High-Risk Employee Profile** :
   Why? To investigate if there are any employee “hotspots” leading turnover rates within the company. 
4.	**Department-Specific Strategies** :
   Why? To assess if attrition rates varied radically by department, to justify necessitating tailored solutions rather than ‘one-size-fits-all’ policy.
5.	**Proactive Monitoring** :
   Why? To recommend real-time tracking of high-risk groups to HR leadership to enable early intervention, turning reactive attrition management into proactive employee retention.
